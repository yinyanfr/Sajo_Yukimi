I was about to call this project "Whisperer" before I found over 400 reps with the same name.

A very simplified self-use front-end only blog framework

### Will do:
- a simple marking language very similiar to json (done)
- a packed up ssh tool for init/upload/modify files
- history and draft function for every article
- multi-language: CN/EN/JP/FR

### Will Not do:
- system of users: he who access to the server is the only owner of each instance
- system for comments: No Commitment
- seo: never bother to attract any attention of searching engines
